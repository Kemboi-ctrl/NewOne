          <h2>Who am I</h2>
          <p class="para">My name is Brandon Kemboi and I am a student currelty attending MCTC. I am currently pursuing
            my computer engineering degree and also looking for jobs or interships for the experience.
            I am also doing small projects for people as I progress to be a better coder and learn something 
            new everyday. I also love
            to travel, snowboard and film a lot. Espcially with my GoPro.

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>HTML was the first language I self-learned. It gave me the chance to 
              dip my toes in the water. It was fast and easy to learn for me. Now
            I believe I am able to teach HTML. </p>

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS is the second language I learned. even though this was a little more 
              complicated than HTML, I was able to get through the courses. I'm Glad now 
              That I am able to style my websites better. I am also learning more each day
              with this language.

            <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
            <p>Bootstap is the code language I am currently learning. I believe it's 
              an important language to learn because of how many websites use it. 
              It is also undating very often so, I must keep up and try to learn more and 
              more about the language.

            <h3>Filiming</h3>
            <p>I have recently started to travel a lot. When I do travel, I usually have a camera beside me. Probably a GoPro.
              It's just a fun activity of mine.</p>

            <h3>Snowboarding</h3>
            <p>Snowboarding is probably the only sport I play which I can say I am good at. I've just started a couple years ago but, was able to pick up a lot.
              I love doing this on my free time.</p>
